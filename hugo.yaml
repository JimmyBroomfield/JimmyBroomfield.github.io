    content: |-
      I am a Principal Data Scientist with a passion for building scalable systems that bridge science, software, and strategy. With a background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, I thrive in an environment where data-driven innovation meets large-scale system design. I currently lead high-impact forecasting and measurement initiatives at Target, where I drive the vision, execution, and delivery of forecasting solutions that directly shape operational decisions and strategy.

      My recent work includes developing a no-history forecasting model, a demand forecast measurement and evaluation framework, and a real-time interactive forecasting model for in-season and pre-season planning. These initiatives deliver experimentation velocity, monitoring, and business capabilities across the organization.

      Beyond technical contributions, I'm deeply committed to mentorship and coaching team members in model development, project design, and technical best practices. I believe that great data science combines rigorous experimentation, scalable engineering, and clear communication to drive measurable impact.

              As a Principal Data Scientist, I drive strategic technical initiatives focused on modernizing our core machine learning infrastructure and enabling enterprise-wide data science innovation. My primary focus is on advancing MLOps practices, designing scalable systems, and building foundational tools that accelerate product development for all data science teams.

              **VertexAI Strategy and Migration**: Led the architectural design and system implementation for migrating a major enterprise forecasting product to Kubeflow Pipelines. This involved significant system planning, technical risk assessment, and hands-on guidance with implementation. Naturally, this involved communication across interested stakeholders and strategic partners.

              **Team Enablement**: Developed and executed the onboarding strategy and training for a team of scientists, successfully transitioning them to the new cloud-native Kubeflow environment and ensuring long-term success with the technologies and platform.

              **Enterprise MLOps Framework**: Actively co-designing and co-developing frameworks and cross-team tooling to accelerate adoption of Vertex AI. These assets will be used by data science teams across Target to standardize product development, experimentation, and deployment at scale.
